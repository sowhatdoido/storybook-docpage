This is a custom DocPage to be used with Storybook 5.3.19.

The Primary Component was replicated so that the `expand` property could be set.

To use, you can either import the `DocPage` that is exported by default, or import `{ Primary }` and use it in your own block configuration.

`<Primary>` supports the properties `expand` (default: true) and `withToolbar` (default: false)
